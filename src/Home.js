          A woman in a village makes ponchos. A peace corp volunteer notices
          that with another machine, instead of making two ponchos in one week
          she could make 20 ponchos. So the volunteer brings her a machine and
          comes back a few months later to observe what he believes will be the
          the huge production of this woman.
