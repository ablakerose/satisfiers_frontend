# README

Needs and Satisfiers

Welcome to Needs and Satisfiers! Needs and Satisfiers is intended to provide users with the ability to track their activities and how well these activities satisfy their nine fundamental human needs.

Installation

Needs and Satisfiers is an application with a rails API backend and a react frontend.  
It runs on ruby '2.6.1'

From the backend directory: https://github.com/ablakerose/satisfiers_backend
Run bundle exec rails server to install necessary rails gem files.
You can find the app by beginning the rails server.

From the front end directory: https://github.com/ablakerose/satisfiers_frontend
Run npm install
Tun npm start

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
